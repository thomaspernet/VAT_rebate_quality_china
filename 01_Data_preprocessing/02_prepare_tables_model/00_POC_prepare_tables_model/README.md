# Data Preprocessing - POC

The folder `01_prepare_tables` should contain one or more notebooks to prepape the raw data before to get them ready for the creation of the final table(s).



This subfolder, `00_POC_prepare_tables` , is meant to try different techniques or the more efficient way to prepare the raw data. It should be done prior to create the notebook in the parent folder (``01_prepare_tables`` ). 

If the data scientist knows precisely how to prepare the raw data, this subfolder is not required.
